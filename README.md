so # # IPSAR Lab – Integration Project Repository

Welcome to the collaborative codebase for the integration work happening across teams at IPSAR Lab. This repository ensures clear coordination, smooth communication, and seamless integration between the backend, frontend, data engineering, and DevOps efforts.

✅ What I’ll Prepare for You:
1. Updated README.md for the Overall Repository
I'll create a clear and professional README with:

Project overview

Team structure

Folder structure

Git workflow

Testing setup

Contribution guidelines

Roadmap

2. Per-Team README.md Files
For:

src/frontend/

src/backend/

src/shared/

data/

tests/

Each will include:

Folder purpose

How to run/setup

Key contributors (optional)

Integration points

3. CI/CD and GitHub Enhancements (Templates and Configs)
I'll also provide templates:

PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md

ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md

.github/CODEOWNERS

.github/labels.yml (for suggested labels)

4. File Structure Enhancements
All changes will not disrupt existing code or team structure — they only add documentation, metadata, and improve workflows.

📦 Deliverables
I will now generate:

Main README content

Team-specific READMEs

GitHub templates

Then I'll compile everything into a single ZIP file or PDF for your upload to GitHub.

Do you want:

ZIP folder with all Markdown files and .github directory?

Or one PDF with everything that you’ll copy manually?

is this correct if puted this matter in my root READ.md folder
